AlarmListener - the Surveillance Camera Client
============================================

Surveillance Camera for Silverlight (Windows Phone) and Qt (Symbian) demonstrates how to use 
Nokia's Notifications API. The Notifications API lets you add real-time push 
notifications to your client applications. The Silverlight application uses the Notifications
Server API to send push notifications to the Symbian device and the Qt application 
uses the Notifications Client API to register as a notification listener. 
The Windows Phone side of the example UI has been implemented using Silverlight and 
the Symbian side has been created with Qt Quick Components.

- The Silverlight application is the actual surveillance camera and searches for
  movements in the camera viewfinder. The application authenticates to the
  Notifications Service for sending alert notifications.
  
- The Qt application (AlarmListener) registers to the Notifications Service
  and receives alert notifications from the Silverlight application.

You need a valid Nokia account ID in order to send and receive notifications.
The Silverlight application sends alert notifications to the selected Nokia account user.
This user must have his or her Nokia account ID enabled after which he or she is able to
receive notifications with the Qt application.   
  
This example application is hosted in Nokia Developer Projects:

1. Using the application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Notifications API is by default in offline state. It means that the Qt application
does not listen for notifications for the "com.demo.notification.dn" application.

To set the API online, switch the "Alarm" toggle button down.
If you have not enabled a Nokia account you are asked to do that by the Notification Framework. 
Notifications are sent to the selected Nokia account user.

When the Notifications Framework reads the notification for the "com.demo.notification.dn" 
application, it starts the Qt AlarmListener application. The application 
reads the incoming alert notification and creates an alert.

For disabling notification listening, switch the "Alarm off" toggle button down.

The application follows the device profile status automatically.

  ListItem, ListHeading, BusyIndicator, Dialog, ToolButton



4. Compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Symbian devices with Qt 4.7.4 or higher.
 
Tested to work on Nokia E7 and Nokia N8. Developed with Qt SDK 1.2.


4.1 Required capabilities
-------------------------

None; the application can be self signed on Symbian.


4.2 Known issues
----------------

None.


5. Building, installing, and running the application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 Preparations
----------------

Check that you have the latest Qt SDK installed in the development environment
and the latest Qt version on the device.

Qt Quick Components 1.1 or higher is required.


5.2 Using the Qt SDK
--------------------

You can install and run the application on the device by using the Qt SDK.
Open the project in the SDK, set up the correct target (depending on the device
platform), and click the Run button. For more details about this approach,
visit the Qt Getting Started section at Nokia Developer
(http://www.developer.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/Getting_started/).


5.3 Symbian device
------------------

Make sure your device is connected to your computer. Locate the .sis
installation file and open it with Nokia Suite. Accept all requests from Nokia 
Suite and the device. Note that you can also install the application by copying
the installation file onto your device and opening it with the Symbian File
Manager application.

After the application is installed, locate the application icon from the
application menu and launch the application by tapping the icon.
